# Car Sales Price Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Welcome to the Car Sales Price Prediction repository, where we have developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict car sales prices. This model is trained on historical data that includes various car features, pricing information, and sales records. By utilizing multiple hidden layers for complex pattern recognition, we have achieved high accuracy in forecasting future car sales trends. This predictive model can be deployed for informed business decisions in the automotive industry.

## Problem Statement

As a vehicle salesperson, you would like to create a model that can estimate the overall amount that consumers would spend given the following characteristics:
- Customer name
- Customer email
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual salary
- Credit card debt
- Net worth

The primary objective is to predict the **Amount Paid for a Car** based on these customer attributes.

## Task Type

- **Task Type:** Regression

## Algorithm

The given problem statement can be solved using Machine Learning or Deep Learning techniques. In this repository, we have chosen to implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the prediction task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is not included in this repository due to its size. You can find the dataset we used [here](https://github.com/rtrchaitanya/Sales-Prediction-Using-Python/blob/main/Car%20Purchasing%20Data.csv), and it should be downloaded and placed in the appropriate location before running the code.

## Usage

You can utilize this repository for the following purposes:

- Train the ANN model for car sales price prediction.
- Customize the model for your specific dataset and problem statement.
- Use the trained model for forecasting car sales prices in your business.

Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, and adapt it to your needs. If you find any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, please contribute or reach out.
